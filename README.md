I chose this particular layout as it was very user-friendly, and was easy to understand regardless of your experience with websites or computers. the navagtion bar was simple, it stayed at the top at all times and highlighted which page the user was on so that they dont get lost. Following the pages i decided to lay them out in a way that would flow when a reader looks through it by starting with the title then a picture along with a map and then contacts. i cose the colours so that there not too bright on the users eyes the british racing green was a dark contrast to the light salmon colour so that the title would stand out without looking ugly and disturbing the user.
A big challenge i faced was handling the responsiveness of the website, to make it compatible with mobile devices and tablets. My problem was that i had issues around the navbar as it refused to cooperate, the problem was sloved by inputing javascript plugins through bootstrap. Another problem i faced was getting the images at the right places on the website as i had trouble grasping bootstraps gridlayout at the start.
